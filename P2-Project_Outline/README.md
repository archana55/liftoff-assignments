# Project Outline

## Overview

My project is to build an app that will allow shoppers to search nearby shopping malls and browse the shops in the mall. Shoppers will also be able to submit reviews and ratings for the malls and stores. 

In addition, this application would support users with admin type roles who will be able to update the list of malls and stores in the Database. Two of these user types are Mall Owner and Store Owner. Mall Owners shall be able to edit their mall's stores list while Store Owners will be able to edit their stores locations.

I chose this project because I like shopping and felt the need for this functionality when I visited new places. I feel other shoppers like me would benefit from an app like this.

## Features

- User Access Permissions: All Users will be able to use the main functionality (search malls/stores and read reviews) of this system without logging in. Users will be able to Log-In or Sign-Up  to the system. Logged in users will have access to additional functionality depending on their user type. Application will support different types of users.  
- Search Malls and/or Stores: All Users will be able to search/browse for nearby malls and/or stores using different types of search filters to explore shopping options. Users can search by location, distance, ratings and other search criteria. Users can also search malls for specific stores.
- Review Malls and Stores: Logged in Users will be able to submit reviews and ratings for Malls as well as for stores. They will also be able to like/dislike other users reviews. This will allow users to make better shopping decisions
- Add/Delete Stores: Each Mall will have a owner(s). Such users will be able to add or delete their mall stores so that the data remains up to date. Each Store can also have a store owner(s) who shall be able to update their mall locations.
- Assign Mall Owners: Administrators will be able to add New Malls and New Stores to the system and assign them Owner(s).

## Technologies

- Java
- Spring Boot

## What I'll Have to Learn

I will have to learn if there is an efficient or automated way to initially populate the database for this system instead of manually entering the data.

I am also planninng on enabling HTTPS to this springboot application. I will have to learn how to implement this.
